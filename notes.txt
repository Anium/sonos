There are two kinds of identifiers in the world of Sonos:
1. objectID, which is what the Browse call deals in
2. resourceID, which is what represents a song or playlist

A zoneplayer's state is a resource URI (CurrentURI) which represents 
the song or playlist it's playing, the number of tracks in that 
resource (1 for a song, N for a playlist), and the current track, 
along with the play state (STOPPED, PLAYING, etc) and the play mode 
(NORMAL, SHUFFLE, etc).

The AVTransport actions Play, Pause, Stop, Next, Previous, Seek act on
this player state.  SetAVTransportURI can be used to change the resource
URI that the player is playing from.  This will cause the player to enter
the STOPPED state.

The Browse call returns both ObjectID and ResourceID for items, allowing
them to be both browsed and played.  The AVTransport can be queried for
its CurrentURI (via GetMediaInfo) but the ObjectID is not returned.  If
you don't know the ResourceID:ObjectID mapping there is no easy way to
find it.

objectIDs exist in hierarchies:
S: is the root of all filesystems the sonos can play from
A: is the root of all metadata hierarchies (A:ARTIST, A:ALBUM, ...)
Q: is the root of "The Queue" which is always Q:0
SQ: is the root of saved queues (user created playlists)

Q:0 can be manipulated by the actions AddURIToQueue, RemoveTrackFromQueue,
RemoveAllTracksFromQueue, ReorderTracksInQueue.  Its contents may be
saved to a SQ:# saved queue (created new or overwritten existing) using
the SaveQueue action.  The SetAVTransportURI call which switches what's
being played never modifies the contents of Q:0 -- you can switch to
an album or any other playlist, and switch back to the main queue later
without losing its state.
